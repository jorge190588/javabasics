/* SUMMARY
 * 

Object Oriented: everything is and object, can be extended since its based on the object model.
Platform independent: is not compiled for specific machine, the code is interpreted by the JVM on whichever platform its being run on.
Secure: authentication techniques are based on public-key encryption.


OOP: fundamental concepts are: Encapsulation, inheritance, polimorphism and abstraction

Class is a template that define attributes and behaviors (methods)

Interface is a reference type, define a collection of abstract methods (behaviors)

Polimorphism is the ability of an object to take on many forms

Abstraction is the quality of dealing with ideas rather than events, hiding the details from the user.

Encapsulation is the mechanism of wrapping the data and code acting on the data together as a sing unit.

Override: is rewrite a behaviors(method) of and object (class)

Inheritance is the process where a class acquires the properties (attributes and methods) of another. Types are: single, multi level, hierarchical and multiple.
